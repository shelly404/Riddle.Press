<h1>Thrasymachus Immortal</h1>

<h3>Laughter, Heteronomy of Wills, and Kant’s Enduring Problem with Exceptions</h3>

<p>Sometime in the fifth century B.C., a possibly fictional sophist called Thrasymachus opened his mouth and launched philosophy into a turbulent debate from which it has yet to recover. Justice, Thrasymachus argued, is the meek man’s game; it only furthers the good of the “stronger” — that is, the one who enjoys the benefits of charity and honesty offered by others while reciprocating none in turn. The most enviable life is that of he who declares himself special, and does to others what he wouldn’t have any to do himself, secure in the knowledge that most aren’t going to do anything to him. Thrasymachus’ dangerous possibility has motivated philosophers throughout the ages, inspiring Socrates’ elaborate metaphors, St. Augustine’s heavenly justice, and, one might say, the intricate moral theories of Kant. Kant’s Grounding for the Metaphysics of Morals has the rigor Socrates lacked, and aspires towards an <em>a priori</em> completeness that one-ups Augustine, pursuing a thread that’s tempted many a philosopher: immorality, it argues, cannot be rationally defended because it’s innately irrational. The man who wills immoral conduct out of self-interest contradicts himself; he fails to realize that his actions move the world towards the opposite of his intended state. Yet Kant’s rigid condemnation of irrational actions, which is based in the universality of rational agents, needs to admit exceptions. He acknowledges some himself, in allowing that some irrational actions conflict only with imperfect duties, and are thus permissible. But this allowance of variance within one’s own action, unless extended to diversity within society’s actions, produces some strange condemnations. And, troublingly, if it is extended to include the heteronomy of wills among imperfect rational beings, allows precisely the parasitic behavior Thrasymachus endorsed.</p>

<p>The foundational premise of Kant’s moral philosophy, the Categorical Imperative, demands that “we must be able to will that a maxim of our action become a universal law,” and in so doing imagine how the world would be changed if everyone acted on the maxim in question (424). When this maxim is moral, Kant claims, the world will be easily imaginable as a consistent and perhaps slightly better place. But when the maxim is immoral, the imagined world which held it as universal law would differ, if not inconceivable, at least so unpleasantly from our own that no rational creature could will the immoral action without contradiction. Thrasymachus, Kant would say, lies, steals, and cheats because he believes it furthers himself. He is mistaken. Were Thrasymachus’ will closely examined “from one and the same standpoint, namely, that of reason,” says Kant, “we would find a contradiction.” He believes immoral actions benefit him, yet simultaneously wills that the opposite behavior remain a universal law — he enjoys existing in a world filled with good and honest people. Thrasymachus holds moral behavior both “objectively necessary as a universal law and yet subjectively [unnecessary]” (424) He has, in Kant’s phrase, “heteronomy of the will” (424), justifying Kant in his proof that immorality is irrational.</p>

<p>Kant divides the world of irrational wills into two camps, based on the extremity of difference encountered in universalization. In one, the maxim willed, if universalized would change the world to such an extent that the original maxim would lose its meaning. The “false promise” is Kant’s trademark example of this species: “A man in need finds himself forced to borrow money. He knows well that he won’t be able to repay it, but he sees also that he will not get any loan unless he firmly promises to repay it within a fixed time” (422). Given his need, is the man justified in making a false promise? This example illustrates the murkiness of consequentialist morality; this man could produce a litany of justifications. His life may be in danger; his creditors would, amidst their riches, hardly notice the loss; it would be a sort of unintentional act of charity on their part. But the Categorical Imperative gives a stern answer. If “everyone believing himself in difficulty” found themselves justified in making false promises, the world would see so much lying that the word “promise” would lose its value (422). The change under this universal maxim is dramatic enough that language changes, and the maxim ceases to possess its original meaning, which for Kant is a sure sign of contradiction within the will. Cases of extremity (like this lie) conflict with what he calls “perfect duties” (e.g. a mandate never to lie) and maintains, with no absence of opposition, must always be enforced.</p>

<p>The second, milder source of inner contradiction is found in actions which. though conceivable as universalized are not desirable. Kant’s chosen example concerns charity: a second man “finds things going well for himself but sees others (whom he could help) struggling with great hardships.” He could aid our first man’s dire circumstances with some generous gift, but feels “no desire to contribute anything to his well-being or to assistance when in need.” However, if he considered the Categorical Imperative he would realize that under this way of thinking “the human race admittedly could very well subsist” but would subsist in such a way that would deny him the “love and sympathy of others... depriving himself by such a law of nature springing from his own will, of all hope of the aid he wants for himself” (423). There is contradiction in this will: it wills self-betterment, but out of short-sightedness fails to recognize that immoral maxims produce its opposite. Abstaining from charity, inasmuch as it diminishes what the will truly wants for itself, is irrational. But as this breed of irrationality can be universalized without contradiction, it conflicts not the “perfect duties” which must always be enacted, but “imperfect duties,” which permit inconsistency in their execution. The man needn’t be charitable whenever the opportunity presents itself.</p>

<p>Kant’s basic premise, that immoral actions are properly understood as irrational actions, is wholly laudable. But one may question his distinction between perfect and imperfect duties. The immoral maxims which conflict with perfect duties may never be enacted, but those “lesser” evils that merely conflict with “imperfect” duties are permissible in moderation. Yet Kant has shown that all types of immorality are irrational: why would irrationality ever be permissible? Stated differently, those types of immoral action which conflict with imperfect duties, and thus can at times be performed, must at times be rational. But this rationality must be granted through some principle other than the Categorical Imperative, which is quite explicit in its condemnation of immoral conduct. Somehow, under the guise of “imperfect duties,” Kant has smuggled in a system of diversity within his binary philosophy, something which permits variances in the individual’s conduct even as it maintains that, societally, maxims must be imagined as universalized.</p>

<h1> A Humorous Counter-example </h1>

<p> A third example may help illustrate the difficulties in this system of division. A woman of jovial disposition thinks it would be funny to refer to her friend, who is called “Caracticus,” as “Bob.” Here, a consequentialist appraisal of the situation returns no warnings. Caracticus may be initially baffled, but his confusion will subside into laughter, and this isolated case will produce no lasting effects. The Categorical Imperative, however, presents a bleaker picture. If the maxim in question, which permits individuals to use names incorrectly whenever they find it humorous, were universalized, the world might change to such an extent that the word “name” loses its original meaning. Arbitrary, ever varying combinations of sound would become so ubiquitous that no one would ever consistently be called anything, in which case the maxim contains an inherent contradiction. Our jovial woman, by Kant’s system, seems to be breaching a perfect duty. Her protestations that she is quite safe violating this convention because she knows that only a small number of people will ever do so reach Kant’s ears in vain. He would condemn this lighthearted deviation under the same heteronomy of the will with which he charged Thrasymachus. She permits herself to do something while willing that everyone else does the opposite. In a word, she imagines that she is special, for which Kant’s rigid system makes no allowance.</p>

<p>Kant’s advocates might, in fairness, reply that the maxim in question (that names may be disregarded whenever people find it humorous) would self-regulate. If society started to deteriorate from an excess of practical jokes, people would understandably stop finding those jokes funny, in which case the maxim would no longer apply. But this subtle self-awareness might be imported into more malignant cases, allowing Thrasymacheans to make false promises under the condition that society was stable enough to endure them — and in any case dwells more eagerly in consequence than Kant would like. His morality is, after all, supposed to be a priori. Irrationality should be discoverable without extended meditation on the effects. [This is Kant's attempt to overcome the paralysis of calculation which arises from utilitarian ethics. One can think of Kant's Categorical Imperative like Hannah Arendt's maxim to be able to "live with yourself" —— both are "calculation aids" to make ethical decision making more immediately accessible.]</p>

<h1> The Parasite Persists </h1>

<p>The root of the problem is the presumption implicit in the Categorical Imperative that our actions should be supposed to become universal actions. A rational being might take shelter in what could be called heteronomy of the wills: the high probability that his or her fellow rational beings will not act in precisely the same way. There is an innate variance in consciousness which makes a diversity of actions all but inevitable, and allows one to deviate from conventions of names just as it allows the other to deviate from conventions of truthfulness, each assured that, however bad the consequences might be if their actions were performed by all, those actions are assuredly not going to be performed by all. Kant would object fiercely to this notion, arguing that it’s not a problem of consequence, but of innate inconsistency which makes the heteronomous will erroneous. But imperfect rational beings such as ourselves are, from one individual to another, rife with inconsistencies in mind and action. Does the <em>heteronomy of the wills</em> justify heteronomy of the will?</p>

<p>Thrasymachus’ most dangerous charge to morality was that by presuming one- self “special,” and granting a oneself license to act individually as one would rather society didn’t, one could simultaneously reap the benefits of immoral hedonism and the structural stability provided by others’ moral actions. Every functional society has parasitic “exceptions”; Thrasymachus argued that it was best to be one. Kant’s Grounding finds lurking irrationality in this distinction of oneself from others, and makes a noble and quite plausible case that immoral action in general is irrational. But even Kant, under the guise of imperfect duties, permits “exceptions” to irrationality, by acknowledging variance in individual behavior, and his resistance to heteronomy of the wills or societal variance leads to some bizarre condemnations of normally appropriate actions. Many have been troubled by Kant’s lack of exceptions, even to lying in order to save a life: the fundamental problem in morality remains whether one can permit practical exceptions without allowing the parasitic exceptions of Thrasymachus.</p>
