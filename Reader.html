<h1>The Homais Problem</h1>

Readers have long been puzzled by the end of Madame Bovary, or rather by the odd continuation of this novel after its fitting end. Flaubert’s third to last chapter is majestic. Emma’s longstanding desire to escape the banality of “real life” is, at last, realized through her death, in a scene complete with glowering doctors, the raucous song of the blind beggar, her hysterical laughter at the juxtaposition of her romantic yearnings with “the beggar’s hideous face, stationed in the eternal darkness like a monster” (267) —what more could a reader ask from a finale? But Flaubert gives us two chapters more which abruptly pivot from the novel’s now deceased protagonist to the egoistic antics of Monsieur Homais, the pharmacist. Homais, amusing for his absurdity but never more than a minor character, is quite unexpectedly granted the last lines of the novel. His quest for the “Medal of the Legion of Honour” assumes a puzzling centrality, leading readers to question Flaubert’s purpose. It’s tempting to read Madame Bovary as a detailed caricature of a character flaw, a warning against Emma’s perverse and insatiable desire to transcend the mundane. But in the final pages, Homais displays a host of desires uncannily similar to those of the deceased Emma Bovary. His quest for the Medal is explicitly related to her turn to adultery — except that, in stark contrast, Homais’ desires appear to be satisfied. Flaubert’s parallel between the two frustrates attempts to moralize Emma’s demise, or attribute her misfortune to a unique and unnatural character flaw. To the contrary, Flaubert argues that the desires that sucked her life are ubiquitous and as inescapable as the dark end foreshadowed by Madama Bovary.
<br>

Emma’s inclinations towards adultery and suicide will, of course, seem alien to most readers. But Flaubert asserts that even these extremes stem from something we can all relate to: a simple discontent with the present. Emma’s yearnings are complex and numerous, but they have their source in a simple realization she expressed at the onset of her marriage: “it seemed quite inconceivable that this calm life of hers could really be the happiness of which she used to dream” (31). This gulf between the ideal and real is precisely what drove Don Quixote mad, and it’s a feeling all can acknowledge. Who could honestly call their life ideal? The real world inevitably pales before the fantastic, leading Emma to “detest common heroes and temperate feelings, the way they are in life” (66) and strive to discover “what was meant in real life by the words felicity, passion, and rapture, which had seemed so fine on the pages of the books” (27). Like Quixote, she refuses to accept the boredom and mundanity of her “calm life.” She has the intelligence both to imagine a wild, romantic “happiness,” and to recognize its incongruity with the “calm life” she finds herself inhabiting.

<h1> Responses to Emma's Quandary</h1>

Flaubert presents us with two responses to this unsettling discontent. The first is that ultimately given by Emma, who rebelled against “the general mediocrity of life” (46) and whose quest to discover the meanings of “felicity, passion, and rapture” terminated in destitution and despair. The second substitutes acceptance for rebellion, and is characterized most strongly by the “venerable” Catherine-Nicaise-Elisabeth Leroux, that dimwitted recipient of a medal for 54 years of agricultural service. The circumstances of our one brief encounter with this Catherine Leroux are telling. Emma, in Leon’s absence, had committed herself to “virtue,” and had perhaps resigned herself to accept the lot life handed, when she found herself suddenly confronted by the full characterization of this resignation and acceptance. “Her thin face, swathed in a simple hood, was more creased and wrinkled than a withered russet apple” and Catherine Leroux’s hands “looked grimy even though they had been rinsed in fresh water; and, from long service, they stayed half unclasped, almost as though to set forth of themselves the simple testimony of so much affliction endured” (120-1). Catherine Leroux, resignation personified, is physically repulsive. Her features make her seem inhuman, as does her absence of feeling, or comprehension of any kind. “No touch of sadness or affection softened that pale gaze,” Flaubert writes “living close to the animals, she had assumed their wordless placid state of being” (121). Emma is repelled, as should we be, by this model of virtue that fails to comprehend its own recognition. The route of acceptance, Flaubert suggests, belongs more fittingly to animals than humans; it’s the route taken by Charles and his bovine ilk, whose happiness is best attributed to their blankness of mind.
We may not quite excuse Emma Bovary for the selfish excesses her discontent occasioned, but we can understand that no one can become anything without feeling that same discontent. Intelligent people, Flaubert suggests, are cursed by the ability to both recognize “the general mediocrity of life” and imagine a world divorced from such mediocrity. The resultant incongruity wakes one from the bovine slumbers, but fills them with a dangerous recklessness. Progress towards a better future necessitates, to some degree, a hatred of present life. In Emma that hatred just happened to reach its hand into the arsenic jar.

<h1> Homais is also Infected </h1>
But our discussion of Emma’s arsenious desires leads oddly back to the supplier of the arsenic: Homais. Following his victory over the blind man, which Flaubert describes as “a campaign that revealed the depth of his intelligence and the malevolence of his vanity,” an emboldened Homais enters a series of temperamental fits exceedingly reminiscent of Emma Bovary. She took subscriptions to the prominent fashion magazines; he takes up philosophy and becomes “preoccupied with the major issues: the social problem, the moralization of the poorer classes, pisciculture, the manufacture of rubber, railways and so on.” This jump from the cultivation of morality to the cultivation of fish might intimate that Homais approaches “philosophy” just as one might approach fashion. “He affected the artistic style, he took up smoking. He bought a pair of chic pompadour statuettes to adorn his parlour… He followed the great chocolate craze” (282) If we aren’t yet reminded of Emma’s litany of clever domestic distractions (“a new way of making paper sconces for candles, or a flounce that she altered on her gown”) and how they “enthralled” dull Charles (47), we need only look to Homais’ “great passion for Pulvermacher hydroelectric body-chains.” “At night, when he took off his flannel vest, Madame Homais lay there bedazzled by the golden spiral wound around his body, and she felt a redoubling of her ardour for this man who was garroted like a Scythian and splendid as a magus” (282). Flaubert’s depiction of an “emboldened” Homais harkens forcefully to the first vanities of Emma.
<br>

Emma, of course, wasn’t satisfied for long with her domestic distractions. She inevitably neglected the housework and closed her piano. Her pens were neglected, and sketch books abandoned as she abandoned herself to a wilder distraction from the mundanity of the everyday. In the course of a few pages, Homais undergoes a similar transformation. “Everything seemed to further his contentment” Flaubert writes, with crucial emphasis on the seemed. “Napoléon helped him in the laboratory, Athalie was embroidering him a skull-cap… He was the happiest of fathers, the most fortunate of men” — but “not quite! He was irked by a secret ambition” (283-4). Emma’s secret was her adultery; Homais only wants “Medal of the Legion of Honor,” but he pursues it in a startlingly similar fashion. In flattering the “powers that be,” Homais “sold himself; in fact, he prostituted himself” (284). This word draws an explicit comparison between Homais and Emma, suggesting that Homais’ pursuit of this medal is every bit a symptom of inner depravity as Emma’s turn to adultery.
None of this is to suggest that Emma Bovary and Homais are the same person. They differ profoundly in character, beauty, temperament; most substantially, Homais finds his desires gratified while Emma does not. His war with the blind beggar does not result in (his) death. He is granted the Legion of Honor. But because, as we’ve explored, the desires of Emma and Homais are remarkably similar, we’re prompted to wonder: why does he get to be happy? A better question might be “Does he get to be happy?” Homais, after all, has only yet progressed through the first of Emma’s fits of discontent. One must wonder if, the Medal obtained, he’ll settle into a “ponderous serenity” (32), suddenly happy with what Flaubert terms “the general mediocrity of life”  (46)— it seems rather more likely that this medal will serve, to Homais, as did the Viscount to Emma: a powerful and unsettling glimpse of the possible which precludes any satisfaction in the actual.
<br>

To interpret Madame Bovary as the sad chronicle of a flawed character does Flaubert a good deal of injustice. The novel continues past Emma Bovary’s death, and the desires that drove her into desperation likewise resound far beyond her grave. There is, to Flaubert, nothing particularly unusual about Emma’s psychology; it’s only one especially tragic instance of the universal discontent that motivates all desires. Emma is not alone in being unwilling to conceive “that this calm life of hers could really be the happiness of which she used to dream” (31); only her rebellion against this discontent distinguishes her from the bovine forms of willingly lowered consciousness. And Flaubert’s mirroring of Emma’s desires onto Homais demonstrates that even this rebellion is scarcely unusual. The plight of Madame Bovary is the plight of humanity, struggling against the incongruity between “real life” and what they imagine life could be. Paradoxically, this discontent with the present seems to be at once the source of human misery and of human progress.
